# CSS animation

## Why this project ? 

This project was designed as an exercise during my training at [BeCode](https://becode.org/)

## Progression 

This project is a work in progress. I have already defined the general layout and the styling, but the animation is missing.

## Remaining issues 

* Image scales but overflows vertically.
* Text overflow should reveal upwards (current: downwards) and with a 400ms transition time (current: instant transition).

Expected result : 
* [Henrique](https://github.com/VieiraHenrique/becode-animation-css)
* [Yvan](https://github.com/Goudmant/becode-animation-css)
